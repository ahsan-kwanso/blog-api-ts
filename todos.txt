will see that ts ignore lines
will make models in ts, this is i guess the most difficult and important as well because changing my models is creating lot of issues in my services
will resolve other parts as well


add return type to services as well

refactor the code
add generics
further add return types
modify the connection
modify the models accordingly
test your application as well

Now I will keep only those requests that I am actually using on frontend, or keep all for practise purposes
